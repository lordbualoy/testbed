Even if they were of higher status, they still lived their lives according to whichever man was head of their family, whether it was their father or husband, women were in a land that was dominated by men.</p><p>Women had to manage their own daily work, including taking care of her family, as well as all of her husband&#x27;s household responsibilities while he was out of the house. Since most people lived in rural areas, tending to farms, a lot of women had to help men with the farm work. However they still received less than men did for doing the same amount of work.</p><h3>Fight Arena</h3><p>The arena is an all-out royal rumble with no teams. Combatants will take on each other. The prize money depends on how many person the combatant can take down before being knocked out</p>
