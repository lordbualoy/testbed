            <div>
                <p>In <a href="Nabillon.html">Nabillon</a>, magic works by converting <a href="Lacertilia.html">Lacertilia</a> energy into work or other form of energies such as kinetic, thermal, electrical, electromagnetic or even form into matters; the conversion efficiency from Lacertilia into other types of energy has a very high efficiency ratio, though converting Lacertilia into matter was much harder and has the lowest efficiency out of all conversion type</p><p>Although a conversion from Lacertilia into other form of energies has a very high efficiency but a reverse process was different, the conversion from other type of energy into Lacertilia has a very very poor efficiency for instance, disenchanting a magic item to regain Lacertilia put into them would only yield much less than one-tenth of the Lacertilia used to initially enchanted the said item</p>
